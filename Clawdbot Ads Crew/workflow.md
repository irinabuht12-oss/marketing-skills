# Weekly Workflow

How to run the Media Buying Squad every Monday

## Schedule

| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| Monday AM | Export fresh data from Google/Meta |
| | Run Performance Auditor first (overall health) |
| | Run Bid & Budget Manager (spend optimization) |
| | Run Creative Analyst if creative decisions needed |
| | Run Audience Architect if scaling or saturation issues |
| | Review all outputs |
| | Execute in platform |

## Step by Step

### 1. Export Data

Pull reports from Google Ads or Meta Ads Manager

- Campaign summary (last 7-14 days)
- Ad-level report if checking creatives
- Ad set report if checking audiences

CSV or copy-paste both work

### 2. Run Performance Auditor

Start here for overall account health

Catches big issues before diving into details

### 3. Run Bid & Budget Manager

Based on auditor findings, optimize spend

Get specific bid and budget recommendations

### 4. Run Creative Analyst (if needed)

Use when:
- Performance dropping
- Scaling campaigns
- Need new creative direction

### 5. Run Audience Architect (if needed)

Use when:
- Frequency getting high
- CPMs rising
- Planning to scale
- Testing new segments

### 6. Review and Execute

Check recommendations make sense

Execute changes in platform

Track results for next week

## Time Required

- Data export: 5 minutes
- Running prompts: 5-10 minutes
- Review: 5-10 minutes
- Total: 15-30 minutes

Compared to 4-6 hours doing this manually
